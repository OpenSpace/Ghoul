 * character. Individual Glyphs can be requested using the #glyph function, which
 * automatically loads and caches missing Glyphs on the first load. The storage backend
 * for Fonts is TextureAtlas into which all Glyphs (regular and outline) are saved. Access
 * into this TextureAtlas is performed on a per-glyph basis and each Glyph stores its
 * texture coordinates in the atlas. Each Font is uniquely identified by the combination
 * of name, font size, whether it has an outline, the thickness of the outline, and the
