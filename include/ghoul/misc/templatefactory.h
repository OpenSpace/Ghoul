/**
 * This class implements a generic Factory pattern that can be used for any class as long
 * as a default constructor and/or constructor taking a Dictionary is available for the
 * subclass. The usage of this TemplateFactory is as follows: The `BaseClass`
 * template parameter is the base class of all classes that can be created using this
 * factory. Only subclasses of `BaseClass` can be added to the factory, or a
 * compile-time error will be generated. Subclasses of the `BaseClass` (or the
 * `BaseClass` itself) can be registered using the #registerClass method, which
 * takes the subclass as a template parameter. All registered classes can then be created
 * using the #create method, providing the same `className` with which the
 * class was registered. If the subclass that was registered provides both an empty
 * default constructor as well as a constructor taking a single
 * `const ghoul::Dictionary&` parameter, the second #create method can be used
 * which takes the `className` as well as the Dictionary with which to
 * instantiate the class. If this method is used and the class does not provide a
 * Dictionary constructor, an exception is thrown. Likewise, if the registered class does
 * not provide a default constructor and is called with the first #create method, a
 * similar exception is thrown. #hasClass tests if a specific `className` was
 * registered previously. For example:
 * \verbatim
class A {};
class B : public A {};
class C {};
class D : public A {
public:
    D(const ghoul::Dictionary&);
};

TemplateFactory<A> factory;
factory.registerClass<B>("B");
factory.registerClass<C>("C"); // compile error as C is not a subclass of A
factory.registerClass<D>("D");
A* i = factory.create("B"); // creates an instance of B with the default constructor
i = factory.create("D"); // creates an instance of D with the default constructor
i = factory.create("D", { }); // creates an instance of D with the Dictionary constructor
i = factory.create("B", { }); // throws an exception as B does not have a Dictionary ctor
