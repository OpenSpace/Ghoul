/**
 * This class is a platform-independent implementation of a shared memory architecture.
 * It provides the possibility to create (#create) and remove (#remove) globally visible
 * blocks of memory that can be used across processes on the same machine for use in
 * inter-process communication. The workflow for this is as follows: One process has to
 * #create a SharedMemory block with a specific name and will keep the ownership of that
 * name. It does not have to create a SharedMemory object itself, but it is the creating
 * process' responsibility to #remove the shared memory at the end of its lifetime; then,
 * other processes can use the constructor with the same name to get access to the shared
 * memory. The overloaded operator void* makes the SharedMemory usable just like a
 * <code>void</code> pointer in the code. The size of the memory is accessible using the
 * #size method. Due to some necessary header information, the amount of memory that is
 * allocated will be slightly larger than the passed amount. The allocated memory
 * automatically provides storage for a thread-safe locking mechanism. In the current
 * implementation, this is using an atomic bool to provide thread-safety. It is possible
 * for a process to acquire exclusive access to the shared memory by calling #acquireLock
 * and relinquish that access by #releaseLock. Please note that this is not a strong
 * safeguard, as any process not using those two methods to guard their access into the
 * memory will not be stopped from reading or writing into the memory. The #acquireLock
 * method will not return until the lock has been acquired. The #releaseLock will return
 * immediately.
