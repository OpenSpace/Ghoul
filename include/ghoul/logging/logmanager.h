/**
 * The central singleton class that is responsible for handling Log%s and logging methods.
 * This singleton class provides methods to add new Log%s, remove Log%s, and relay
 * messages to all Log%s added to the LogManager. A log message consists of a
 * LogLevel, a category and a message. The category is mainly used as a prefix
 * and/or grouping within the log files and may have other meanings depending on the
 * specific Log%s. The LogManager instance has to be initialized with the #initialize
 * method and can be accessed using the #ref method afterwards. Initializing an instance
 * twice or accessing an uninitialized LogManager will result in an assertion. The logging
 * is performed thread-safe.
 *
 * The different LogLevel available are: LogLevel::Debug,
 * LogLevel::Info, LogLevel::Warning, LogLevel::Error,
 * LogLevel::Fatal.
 * If a LogManager was created with a LogLevel x, all messages with
 * LogLevel y <= x will be passed to Log handler.
 *
 * Macros are defined to make logging messages easier. These macros are: #LDEBUG,
 * #LDEBUGC, #LINFO, #LINFOC, #LWARNING, #LWARNINGC, #LERROR, #LERRORC, #LFATAL, #LFATALC.
 * The *C versions of the macros requires the category and the message as a parameter. The
 * versions without the C require an <code>std::string</code> variable named
 * <code>_loggerCat</code> to be defined in the scope of the macro "call".
