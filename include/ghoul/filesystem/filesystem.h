 * accessed and changed (#currentDirectory), #setCurrentDirectory, #setCurrentDirectory).
 * All methods that require a Directory or File parameter can use an
 * <code>std::string</code> or <code>char*</code> directly as this will be converted into
 * a lightweight Directory or File object. The main functionality of the FileSystem is to
 * deal with path tokens. These are tokens of the form <code>${...}</code> which are like
 * variables, pointing to a specific location. These tokens are resolved in various
 * methods (for example #absolutePath) and thus be used to dynamically set, for example,
 * asset paths with only one point of specification. These tokens can only be bound once,
 * as some of the tokens might already have been resolved and changing the tokens later
 * might lead to inconsistencies. For the same reason, it is not possible to unregister
 * tokens. Every FileSystem contains one token <code>${TEMPORARY}</code> that points to
 * the location of the system's temporary files.
