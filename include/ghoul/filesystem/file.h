 * to be able to extract parts of the path like the #baseName, the #directoryName, or the
 * #fileExtension. The second functionality of this class is a platform-independent way of
 * being notified of changes of the file. The constructor or the #setCallback methods
 * expect an <code>std::function</code> object (possibly initialized using a lambda-
 * expression) that will be called whenever the file changes on the hard disk. The
 * callback function has this object passed as a parameter. If many changes of the file
 * happen in quick succession, each change will trigger a separate call of the callback.
 * The file system is not polled, but the changes are pushed to the application, so the
 * changes are registered efficiently and are solely impacted by the overhead of
 * <code>std::function</code>.
