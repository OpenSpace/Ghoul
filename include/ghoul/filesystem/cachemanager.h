 * The CacheManager allows users to request a storage location for an, optionally

 * the file paths and does not do any caching itself. The use case for this is are
 * two-fold:<br>
 * First, expensive operation that has a result, which gets written to a file and the
 * developer wants to retain the results without recomputing it at every application
 * start. For this, a cache file is requested with the getCachedFile method and the
 * <code>isPersistent</code> flag set to <code>true</code>. Using the same
 * <code>file</code> and <code>information</code> values, the same path will be retrieved
 * in subsequent application runs.<br>
 * The second use-case is a temporary file, also with the getCachedFile method, but the
 * <code>isPersistent</code> flag set to <code>false</code>. Non-persistent files will
 * automatically be deleted when the program ends.<br>
 * The persistent files are stored in a <code>cache</code> file so that they can be
 * retained between application runs. If two CacheManagers are pointing at the same
 * directory, the result is undefined.
